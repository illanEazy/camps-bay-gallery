            <p class="text-regular text-white mb-md">Between the mountain and the sea, where light shifts with every hour, we found the place where art belongs. Camps Bay isn't just location—it's atmosphere. It's the feeling of discovery, the quiet confidence of a place that knows its worth.</p>
            <p class="text-regular text-white mb-lg">We built ChemSpace to be part of this landscape. A gallery where contemporary work finds its natural home, where artists and collectors meet without pretense, where every visit feels like finding something you weren't looking for.</p>
