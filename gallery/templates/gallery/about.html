            <p class="text-large mb-md" style="line-height: 1.8;">
                Founded in 2018, Camps Bay Art Gallery emerged from a simple belief: great art deserves an extraordinary setting. 
                Nestled between the iconic Twelve Apostles and the Atlantic Ocean, our gallery is more than a space—it's an experience.
